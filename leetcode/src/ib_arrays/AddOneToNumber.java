	 * Add One To Number
	 * 
	 * Asked in: Google Microsoft
	 * 
	 * Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,add 1 to the
	 * number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).
	 * 
	 * The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of
	 * the list.
	 * 
	 * Example:
	 * 
	 * If the array has [1, 2, 3]
	 * 
	 * the returned vector should be [1, 2, 4]
	 * 
	 * as 123 + 1 = 124.
	 * 
	 * NOTE: Certain things are intentionally left unclear in this question which
	 * you should practice asking the interviewer.
	 * 
	 * For example, for this problem, following are some good questions to ask :
	 * 
	 * Q : Can the input have 0â€™s before the most significant digit. Or in other
	 * words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input?
	 * 
	 * A : For the purpose of this question, YES
	 * 
	 * Q : Can the output have 0â€™s before the most significant digit? Or in other
	 * words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output?
	 * 
	 * A : For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before
	 * the most significant digit.
